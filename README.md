# Object_Detection_and_Image_Classification

I've implemented multi-label image classifier on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. The classifier.py file conatains simple network base architecture and custom built architecure to improve accuracy achieved by AlexNet.

In order to implement a YOLO-like object detector on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset to detects object belonging to one of the classes in dataset, I've developed yolo_loss.py file.

Additional code like training loops or additinal files can be developed easily by yourself.
